## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I really have no idea quite yet what I want my project to be, but maybe I can expand more on my job posting website or rework it. I would like to do more with the user class so I can have a more customized experience for the user. I also want to incorporate an API

### Features

Some features I'd like to include are custom user classes with roles, search functionality with a front end filter, and possibly better email functionality. 

### Technologies

C#, .NET, MySQL, Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll have to figure out which API to incorporate and better learn how to do that.
